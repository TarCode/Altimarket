# Alti

Alti is a decentralized rental platform with escrow service built on Ethereum. 

## Technology stack
Alti is built using Truffle, React, Web3 and DAI.js

Alti is still in development and only functions as a proof of concept on the KOVAN TESTNET demonstrating:
- Adding a listing 
- Viewing a listing 
- Chatting to the seller
- Buy a listing (CDP gets opened for DAI and gets sent to seller)

The following is incomplete:
- Raiden network integration
- Escrow smart contract integration

### Team
- **Nurha Leite** - Research, planning, testing
- **Taariq Isaacs** - Development
- **Alex Marais** - UI, UX and Graphics
